question: Did you test every possible combinations?
---
No. There are just way too many combinations (hundreds of them actually) but we do our best to test a maximum of them. If you have any trouble with a particular combination, please run `ignition issue`, this will open a new tab in your Browser and prefill a GitHub issue with your current answers to all prompts. Just add the problem and we will take care of it.
